This code corrects for covariate effects in proteomic data, where variables like age, sex, batch, cell lines or sample preparation can introduce unwanted variation. Using a multivariate linear model, we quantify and remove each covariateâ€™s influence on protein levels, yielding residuals that reflect biologically relevant differences more accurately.

To evaluate the correction, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) before and after adjustment. By examining PCA plots, we can confirm whether covariate-driven clustering is minimized, indicating that the data is now better suited for identifying condition-specific protein changes.
